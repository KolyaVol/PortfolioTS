				Hello again everyone! A little about myself: I've graduated Belarusian
				State Technological University in 2021, went through the army and worked
				as a designer in the chemical industry for one year. I start thinking
				about programming 2 years ago but start learning right after army. Now
				I've almost a year of experiance in web-programming and I realy enjoy
				this profession. What you really need to know about me is that I always
				reach my goal, and right now that goal is to be a good IT specialist. My
				hobbies are sport, travelling, computer games and the new one - writting
				code. By trusting me, you will get maximum return for your project!
